# E5Plus-Marlin-Custom
My custom build of Marlin for my Ender 5 Plus, based on [Carlos33193's](https://www.reddit.com/r/BIGTREETECH/comments/xiolsp/comment/jlpllll/) and then adjusted for my own needs.
Real quick list of my printer specs so it's not confusing, I'll expand this later:
- Ender 5 Plus
- BTT SKR Mini E3V3 board
- MicroSwiss Direct Drive Extruder
- 0.4mm Micro Swiss Nozzle
- Creality CRTouch
- Filament Runout Sensor

## TODO:
- More thorough list of printer specifications to indicate what my build is
- Annotate what has changed from stock (I have my notes, just need to transcribe the shorthand)
- Include G-Code customization and changes
